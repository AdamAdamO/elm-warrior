# Elm Warrior

This is a game where you learn Elm by programming the AI of the brave warrior, named at, as it navigates mazes and battles dangerous opponents. You can find all documentation you need here but to get started quickly, I recommend you clone [this repo](https://github.com/Skinney/elm-warrior-starter) to your local harddrive. 

If you complete all the builtin levels, you can try to make some of your own, or you can challenge your friends in a warrior deathmatch by cloning [this repo](https://github.com/Skinney/elm-warrior-multiplayer) and copying in your implementations.
